# Loan Prediction using SVM: 
by Aanya Tripathi


## Project Overview
The loan status prediction project aims to automate and streamline the loan approval process by employing machine learning algorithms. 
By analyzing historical loan application data, the project facilitates accurate predictions on new, unseen loan applications, enabling financial institutions to make
informed decisions efficiently.

##Key Features
Data Collection and Processing: 
The project involves collecting loan application data and performing data preprocessing tasks. Using Pandas, the collected data is cleaned, filtered, and transformed to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

Data Visualization: 
The project utilizes Seaborn to create insightful visualizations that help gain a deeper understanding of the loan application data. By plotting histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices, the project uncovers valuable patterns and relationships within the data.

Train-Test Split: To build a robust loan status prediction model, the project employs the train-test split technique. This division ensures that the model is trained on a subset of data and evaluated on unseen data, providing an accurate assessment of its performance.

Support Vector Machine Model: The project utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a powerful classification method, to train the loan status prediction model. 
By employing the SVM implementation provided by Scikit-learn, the model learns from the historical loan application data to make accurate predictions on new applications. The final model hasa n 83.33% accuracy on the testing data.

Model Evaluation: To assess the effectiveness of the loan status prediction model, the project employs various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
These metrics provide insights into the model's performance and its ability to generalize to unseen data.
